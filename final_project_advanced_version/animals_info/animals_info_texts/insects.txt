Insects are a class of animals in the arthropod system.
They are easy to identify by body shape divided into three parts, head, chest and abdomen and three pairs of legs (total 6 legs).
Insects do not harm humans. Their role is important to us, due to their ability to pollinate agricultural crops, break down waste, or enrich the soil with nutrients.
Among other things, they may transmit diseases or damage agricultural crops. Therefore can sometimes be harmful to a person.
