The cow is a farm animal from the cattle family.
Man uses cows for a variety of uses: cows are used as beasts of burden and plowing, used for milking, slaughtered for food, their skin produces leather products, and their bones produce glue.
A cow is not a dangerous animal, but man raises it for his needs.
