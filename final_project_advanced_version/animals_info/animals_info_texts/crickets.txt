Cricket is a common insect from the grasshopper family.
(in Hebrew) The cricket's name was given to it, apparently as an imitation of the sound of the cricket that the male makes by rubbing his front wings against each other.
The cricket feeds on the animal and the rot, and lives in dimples or thickets of vegetation, and therefore belongs to the family of the earth's inhabitants.
A cricket is not a dangerous animal to man.
