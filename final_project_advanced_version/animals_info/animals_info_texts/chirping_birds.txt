Chirping birds is a giant avian series that includes more than half of the avian class. There are about 5,400 species in the series, which makes it the most diverse series of vertebrates (more than the rodent series, which is the largest in the mammal series). The Chirping birds have a worldwide distribution, on all continents except Antarctica, and the greatest variety of species is in the tropics.
The Chirping birds have a musical vocal ability.
A wide variety of appearances and diverse behaviors, their small size and the relative ease of watching these birds, have made many species in this series familiar and beloved among different cultures, as well as research objects of scientists from the life sciences.
Chirping birds are not dangerous to humans, and sometimes humans breed them as pets
